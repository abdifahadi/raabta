## ‚úÖ Fixed Issues

### 1. **Firestore Index Missing Error** ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem:** "Failed to load groups" with index requirement error
**Solution:** Added missing composite index for groups collection
```json
{
  "collectionGroup": "groups",
  "queryScope": "COLLECTION",
  "fields": [
    {
      "fieldPath": "members",
      "arrayConfig": "CONTAINS"
    },
    {
      "fieldPath": "updatedAt",
      "order": "DESCENDING"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. **Conversation Deletion Permission Error** ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem:** "Missing or insufficient permissions" when deleting conversations
**Solution:** Updated Firestore security rules to allow participants to delete conversations:
```javascript
// Conversations collection (for private chats)
match /conversations/{conversationId} {
  // Allow conversation participants to delete conversations
  allow delete: if request.auth != null && 
    request.auth.uid in resource.data.participants;
}
```

### 3. **Flutter Compatibility Issues** ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem:** `withValues` method not available in Flutter 3.24.5
**Solution:** Replaced all `withValues(alpha: x)` with `withOpacity(x)` throughout the codebase

### 4. **Group Creation Working But Not Displaying** ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem:** Groups were created successfully but not appearing in the groups tab
**Root Cause:** Missing Firestore index prevented the groups query from executing
**Solution:** Added the required composite index for `members` (array-contains) and `updatedAt` (descending)
