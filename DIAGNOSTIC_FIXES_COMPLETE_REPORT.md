# Raabta App - Complete Diagnostic Fixes Report

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. Critical Error Fix
**Issue**: `argument_type_not_assignable` in `lib/main.dart` (Line 345)
- **Problem**: CardTheme cannot be assigned to CardThemeData parameter
- **Solution**: Changed `CardTheme` to `CardThemeData` in theme configuration

```dart
// Before:
cardTheme: const CardTheme(...)

// After:
cardTheme: const CardThemeData(...)
```

### 2. Deprecated API Fixes
**Issue**: `deprecated_member_use` for `withOpacity()` method across 20 files
