# Profile Setup Screen Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds a full-featured profile setup screen that appears after Google Sign-In, allowing users to complete their profile information before accessing the main application.

## Architecture
The implementation follows clean architecture principles with separate domain, data, and presentation layers.

### Files Created/Modified

#### New Model Files
- `lib/features/auth/domain/models/user_profile_model.dart`: Complete user profile model with all required and optional fields
  - Includes enums for Gender and RelationshipStatus
  - Supports Firestore serialization/deserialization
  - Has profile completion validation

#### New Repository Files
- `lib/features/auth/domain/user_profile_repository.dart`: Interface for profile operations
- `lib/features/auth/domain/firebase_user_profile_repository.dart`: Firebase implementation
  - Handles profile creation, updates, and retrieval
  - Manages profile completion status

#### New Presentation Files
- `lib/features/auth/presentation/profile_setup_screen.dart`: Main profile setup UI
  - Responsive design for all platforms
  - Form validation for required fields
  - Optional field handling
  - Date picker integration
  - Profile photo management (placeholder for future photo picker)

#### Modified Files
- `lib/core/services/service_locator.dart`: Added UserProfileRepository dependency injection
- `lib/features/auth/presentation/sign_in_screen.dart`: Updated to check profile completion
- `lib/features/auth/presentation/auth_wrapper.dart`: Enhanced to handle profile flow
- `lib/features/home/presentation/home_screen.dart`: Updated to display profile information

## Data Structure

### UserProfileModel Fields

#### Required Fields (must be filled to continue):
- `name`: User's full name
- `gender`: Selected from Gender enum (Male, Female, Other, Prefer not to say)
- `activeHours`: User's active hours (e.g., "9 AM - 6 PM")

#### Optional Fields:
- `photoUrl`: Profile photo URL (editable, defaults from Google)
- `bio`: Personal bio/description
- `religion`: Religious affiliation
- `relationshipStatus`: Selected from RelationshipStatus enum
- `dateOfBirth`: Date of birth (with date picker)

#### System Fields:
- `uid`: User ID from Firebase Auth
- `email`: Email from Google Sign-In
- `createdAt`: Account creation timestamp
- `lastSignIn`: Last sign-in timestamp
- `isProfileComplete`: Boolean flag for completion status

### Firestore Structure
```
users/{uid} {
  uid: string,
  email: string,
  createdAt: timestamp,
  lastSignIn: timestamp,
  name: string,
  gender: string,
  activeHours: string,
  photoUrl: string?,
  bio: string?,
  religion: string?,
  relationshipStatus: string?,
  dateOfBirth: timestamp?,
  isProfileComplete: boolean
}
```

## User Flow

1. **Sign-In**: User signs in with Google
2. **Profile Check**: System checks if user profile exists and is complete
3. **Profile Setup**: If incomplete, user is directed to ProfileSetupScreen
4. **Form Filling**: User fills required fields and optional fields
5. **Validation**: System validates required fields before allowing continuation
6. **Save & Navigate**: Profile is saved to Firestore and user navigates to HomeScreen

## Features

### Required Field Validation
- Name field validation (cannot be empty)
- Gender selection (dropdown with enum values)
- Active hours input with validation
- Form prevents submission until all required fields are filled

### Optional Field Handling
- Bio text field (multi-line)
- Religion text field
- Relationship status dropdown
- Date of birth picker with calendar widget
- Profile photo editing (placeholder for future implementation)

### Skip Functionality
- "Skip for now" button only appears when required fields are filled
- Allows users to save partial profile and complete later
- Sets `isProfileComplete: false` for skipped profiles

### Responsive Design
- Single-column layout with sections
- Proper spacing and padding
- Material Design components
- Cross-platform compatibility (Android, iOS, Web, Desktop)

### Error Handling
- Network error handling with user feedback
- Form validation with inline error messages
- Loading states during save operations
- Graceful fallback for authentication errors

## Service Locator Integration
The implementation updates the ServiceLocator to include:
```dart
UserProfileRepository get userProfileRepository => _userProfileRepository;
```

This allows dependency injection throughout the app for consistent data access.

## Navigation Flow Updates

### AuthWrapper Enhanced Logic
```
User Signed In → Check Profile → 
  ├── Profile Complete → HomeScreen
  ├── Profile Incomplete → ProfileSetupScreen
  └── No Profile → Create Initial Profile → ProfileSetupScreen
```

### Sign-In Screen Updates
After successful Google Sign-In:
1. Check existing profile completion status
2. Route to appropriate screen (Home vs Profile Setup)
3. Create initial profile if none exists

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Photo Picker**: Integration with image_picker package for custom profile photos
2. **Social Login**: Support for Facebook, Apple, and other providers
3. **Profile Editing**: Allow users to edit profile after completion
4. **Privacy Settings**: Control visibility of profile fields
5. **Profile Verification**: Email/phone verification badges

### Technical Improvements
1. **Offline Support**: Cache profile data for offline access
2. **Performance**: Implement profile data caching
3. **Analytics**: Track profile completion rates
4. **A/B Testing**: Test different profile setup flows

## Testing Considerations

### Unit Tests Needed
- UserProfileModel serialization/deserialization
- Repository methods (save, retrieve, update)
- Profile validation logic
- Navigation flow logic

### Integration Tests
- Complete sign-in to profile setup flow
- Profile save and retrieval from Firestore
- Form validation scenarios
- Cross-platform UI consistency

### UI Tests
- Form field interactions
- Date picker functionality
- Dropdown selections
- Button state changes
- Navigation transitions

## Dependencies
No new dependencies were added. The implementation uses existing packages:
- `firebase_auth`: User authentication
- `cloud_firestore`: Data persistence
- `google_sign_in`: Google authentication
- `intl`: Date formatting
- `flutter/material.dart`: UI components

## Conclusion
This implementation provides a comprehensive, scalable profile setup system that follows Flutter best practices and clean architecture principles. The code is maintainable, testable, and ready for future enhancements while ensuring a smooth user experience across all supported platforms.
