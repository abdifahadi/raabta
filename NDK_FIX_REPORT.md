# Raabta App - NDK and Build Issues Resolution Report

## Issue Summary
The original error was:
```
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.
* What went wrong:
A problem occurred configuring project ':agora_rtc_engine'.
> [CXX1101] NDK at C:\Users\mdabd\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\ndk\25.1.8937393 did not have a source.properties file
```

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Missing Flutter SDK**: Flutter was not installed in the development environment
2. **Missing Android SDK**: Android SDK and NDK were not properly installed
3. **Incorrect NDK Version**: Project was configured with older NDK version (23.1.7779620) but Agora RTC Engine required NDK 25.1.8937393
4. **SDK Version Mismatch**: compileSdk and targetSdk versions were incompatible with newer dependencies
5. **Missing Permissions**: Android manifest lacked required permissions for Agora RTC Engine

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Flutter SDK Installation
- Downloaded and installed Flutter 3.24.5 (stable)
- Configured PATH environment variable
- Disabled Flutter analytics

### 2. Android SDK Setup
- Downloaded Android Command Line Tools (11076708)
- Installed Android SDK Platform 34 and 35
- Installed Android Build Tools 34.0.0
- Installed NDK 25.1.8937393 (required by Agora)
- Configured ANDROID_HOME environment variable

### 3. Project Configuration Updates

#### android/app/build.gradle
```gradle
android {
    compileSdk = 35                    // Updated from flutter.compileSdkVersion
    ndkVersion = "25.1.8937393"       // Updated from flutter.ndkVersion
    
    defaultConfig {
        minSdk = 23                   // Updated from 21 (required by Firebase Auth)
        targetSdk = 35                // Updated from flutter.targetSdkVersion
    }
    
    compileOptions {
        coreLibraryDesugaringEnabled true  // Added for flutter_local_notifications
    }
}

dependencies {
    coreLibraryDesugaring 'com.android.tools:desugar_jdk_libs:2.1.4'  // Added
}
```

#### android/gradle.properties
```properties
# Disabled configuration cache due to compatibility issues
org.gradle.configuration-cache=false
```

#### android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
Added required permissions for Agora RTC Engine:
```xml
<!-- Required permissions for Agora RTC Engine -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WAKE_LOCK" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
```

### 4. File Cleanup
- Removed conflicting `android/app/build.gradle.kts` file
