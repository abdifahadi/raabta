## Recommendations 📝

### For Complete Cross-Platform Testing
1. **iOS/macOS Builds**: Requires macOS host with Xcode
2. **Windows Build**: Requires Windows host with Visual Studio
3. **Production Deployment**: Test on actual target platforms

### Code Quality Improvements
1. Replace deprecated `Share` API with `SharePlus.instance.share()`
2. Remove unused `_currentToken` fields or implement usage
3. Replace `print` statements with proper logging in production

### Performance Optimizations
- Asset tree-shaking is working effectively (99%+ reduction)
- Consider enabling `--no-tree-shake-icons` if icons are missing
