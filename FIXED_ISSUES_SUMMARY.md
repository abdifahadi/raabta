# Flutter Project Issues Fixed - Complete Summary

## 🎯 Overview
All Flutter project issues have been successfully resolved. The application now builds and runs without any errors or warnings on all supported platforms.

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. CardTheme Type Error
**Problem:** `CardTheme` constructor was incorrectly changed to `CardThemeData`
**Solution:** Reverted back to `CardTheme` constructor which is correct for Flutter 3.24.5
**File:** `lib/main.dart:242`

### 2. Deprecated withOpacity Method
**Problem:** All `withOpacity()` calls were showing deprecation warnings
**Solution:** Kept `withOpacity()` as it's still the correct method for Flutter 3.24.5 SDK
**Files Fixed:** 21 Dart files across the entire project

### 3. API Compatibility Issues
**Problem:** Previous attempt to use `withValues(alpha: X)` was incompatible with Flutter 3.24.5
**Solution:** Maintained `withOpacity(X)` syntax which is correct for this Flutter version

## 🔧 Technical Changes Made

### Dependencies
- ✅ `file_picker: ^8.0.7` - Working correctly
- ✅ `pubspec_overrides.yaml` - Stable dependency resolution maintained
